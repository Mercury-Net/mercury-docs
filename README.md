## Background and Key Challenges we faced

With the rapid development of blockchain technology and the Web3 ecosystem, global cryptocurrency transaction volumes have seen explosive growth over the past decade. According to Chainalysis' 2023 report, the total on-chain transaction volume has surpassed trillions of dollars, covering a wide range of scenarios from individual investments to decentralized finance (DeFi). However, this fast-expanding digital economy also brings significant challenges: On one hand, the anonymity and decentralization of on-chain activities provide unprecedented freedom and privacy for users, but they also create a breeding ground for illegal activities such as money laundering and tax evasion. On the other hand, governments around the world are strengthening regulatory efforts, requiring on-chain participants to meet tax compliance and identity verification requirements. This conflict between compliance and privacy has become one of the core bottlenecks for the development of Web3.

Traditional on-chain identity and compliance solutions often fail to strike a balance. Existing KYC (Know Your Customer) processes typically rely on centralized institutions, forcing users to expose sensitive personal information to third parties, which violates Web3's principles of decentralization and privacy. At the same time, the complexity of on-chain transactions, such as cross-chain asset transfers and DeFi protocol interactions, makes tax compliance a challenge for both individual users and protocol developers. It is estimated that in 2022 alone, global tax losses due to incomplete cryptocurrency tax reporting reached hundreds of billions of dollars. Meanwhile, there is an increasing demand from users and developers for privacy protection, especially in the context of data breaches and excessive regulatory intervention.

Mercury aims to become the world’s first on-chain compliance verification infrastructure based on Zero-Knowledge Proofs (zkProof), providing a trust solution that balances privacy protection and compliance needs, focusing on addressing two core pain points: on-chain identity verification and tax compliance. As blockchain technology and decentralized finance (DeFi) rapidly evolve, the Web3 ecosystem is reshaping the global economic landscape. According to the Chainalysis 2023 report, global on-chain transaction volumes have exceeded trillions of dollars, covering diversified scenarios ranging from individual investments to complex DeFi protocol interactions. However, this rapid expansion also brings notable challenges:

* **The Conflict Between Privacy and Compliance**: The anonymity and decentralization of on-chain activities provide users with freedom and privacy but also create potential grounds for illegal activities like money laundering and tax evasion. Meanwhile, governments worldwide are tightening their regulatory measures, such as the IRS requiring cryptocurrency traders to report capital gains tax, and the European Union’s MiCA regulation enhancing on-chain activity oversight.
* **Limitations of Traditional Solutions**: Centralized KYC processes require users to expose sensitive information to third parties, which conflicts with Web3’s decentralization principles. The complexity of on-chain transactions (e.g., cross-chain asset transfers, DeFi yield calculations) makes tax compliance a challenge for both individual users and protocol developers.
* **Urgency of Economic Losses**: According to statistics, global tax losses due to incomplete cryptocurrency tax reporting reached hundreds of billions of dollars in 2022, highlighting the urgent need for compliance tools.

Mercury was created to address these challenges by leveraging technological innovation to bridge the gap between privacy and compliance, providing a secure, efficient, and trustworthy compliance infrastructure for the Web3 ecosystem.

## Mission

To build the world's first on-chain compliance verification infrastructure based on Zero-Knowledge Proofs, providing a trust solution for the Web3 world that balances compliance and privacy, and solving two key issues: **on-chain identity verification and tax compliance.**

## Mercury’s Core Values and Technological Advantages

The core value of Mercury lies in achieving a balance between privacy and compliance through technological innovation, offering a multi-party win-win solution for users, protocols, and regulators. Specifically, its value is reflected in the following aspects:
