# Technical Implementation Path

## Sub-chain 1: From Centralized to Decentralized

* Centralized Data Collection + Centralized Tagging Model + Centralized Tagging Database
* Provides data services

## Sub-chain 2: From L2 to L1

Sub-chain 2 will launch as a dedicated Ethereum Layer 2, independently operating the zkPassport protocol for identity management and credential verification. This Layer 2 fully relies on the Ethereum mainnet as the data availability and final settlement layer. As the network develops and its functionality expands, the zkPassport Layer will gradually evolve into a Layer 1 blockchain with independent consensus and data sovereignty, supporting a larger-scale Web3 identity ecosystem and compliance infrastructure.
