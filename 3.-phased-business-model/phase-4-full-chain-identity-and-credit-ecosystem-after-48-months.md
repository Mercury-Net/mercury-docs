# Phase 4: Full-Chain Identity and Credit Ecosystem (After 48 months)

In the fourth phase, Mercury will explore the ultimate vision of full-chain identity verification, aiming to create a comprehensive identity and credit ecosystem. The goal is to expand TRID into a universal identity standard for Web3, supporting a wider range of application scenarios. This phase will empower use cases such as DeFi lending and NFT trading by launching cross-chain identity verification and credit scoring systems, solidifying Mercury's core position in the Web3 ecosystem.

* **Core Objective:** Build a full-chain identity and credit ecosystem, expanding TRID into a universal identity standard for Web3 and enabling a variety of scenarios.
* **Revenue Sources:** All parties (individual, business and government) will be able to pay for the verification of specific information of another role across various scenarios. The fees will be distributed between the information owners and Mercury network nodes, enabling the full operation of the economic system within the ecosystem.
* **Implementation Path:** Based on the validation of technology and market acceptance in the first three phases, Mercury will gradually refine its revenue model and market strategy, driving TRID to become the "digital passport" of Web3.
