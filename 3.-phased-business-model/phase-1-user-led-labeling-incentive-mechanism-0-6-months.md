# Phase 1: User-Led Labeling Incentive Mechanism (0-6 Months)

Users can annotate their own on-chain transaction data (e.g., transaction types, address identities) through Mercuryâ€™s smart contracts. In return, the system rewards users with points based on the quality and quantity of their contributions, fostering a user-driven tagging ecosystem.

## Core Objectives:

* Incentivizes user participation in building on-chain data infrastructure
* Establishes a high-quality tag knowledge base to support advanced services
* Points can be redeemed for services, governance participation, or platform engagement benefits

## Revenue Sources:

* Ecosystem Incentives from Public Chains: Collaborate with major blockchains to receive rewards for contributing to the ecosystem (e.g., grants, technical integration incentives).
* Gas Subsidy Mechanism: Encourage user participation by reimbursing gas fees, supported by public chains or DApps partners.
