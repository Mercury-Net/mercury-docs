# Phase 3: Individual Users Payment Model ( 13-24Months)

In the 3rd phase of the project, Mercury will focus on acquiring users and accumulating an on-chain data labeling library. The goal is to establish a TRID adoption flywheel, laying the foundation for user and data growth in subsequent phases. The primary revenue sources will consist of three parts:

1. TRID Minting Fee: Priced at 0.99 USDC per TRID (first batch users will enjoy free or limited-time discounted minting), lowering the entry barrier for users.
2. VC Generation Service Fee: Tiered pricing based on credential complexity. For example, generating simple address verification credentials is free, while more complex credentials like tax compliance proofs are charged at 0.5 USDC per instance.
3. Data Labeling API Fee:0.005 USDC per API call for developers building tax tools, encouraging the participation of the developer ecosystem.

To rapidly enter the market, Mercury will adopt a multi-dimensional marketing strategy:

* Wallet Integration and Revenue Sharing: Integrate with mainstream wallets like MetaMask and Trust Wallet, using wallets as both a traffic entry point and interaction tool, with a revenue-sharing model.
* Airdrop Campaigns and Points System: Drive user participation via airdrop campaigns and a Mercury points panel. Combine with a task system to incentivize users to mint TRID and generate VCs.
* Community Building and KOL Marketing: Expand brand influence through community engagement and KOL marketing, targeting Web3-native users.
* Referral Reward Mechanism: Introduce a referral reward mechanism, offering 0.5 USDC rebate for every successful TRID referral, accelerating user growth through viral marketing.

## Core Objectives:

* Build the TRID user growth flywheel through airdrop expectations for Mercury tokens.
* Enable users to earn points by minting TRID and generating VCs.
* Allow users to improve the on-chain data labeling library by manually tagging data, further increasing their point balance.

## Revenue Sources:

* TRID Minting Fee: 0.99 USDC per TRID.
* VC Generation Service Fee: Tiered pricing based on complexity (e.g., tax compliance proof at 0.5 USDC per instance).

## Market Entry Strategy:

* Wallet Integration and Revenue Sharing (wallets as a traffic entry point and interaction tool).
* Airdrop-driven campaigns (with points panel and task system).
* Community and KOL marketing.
