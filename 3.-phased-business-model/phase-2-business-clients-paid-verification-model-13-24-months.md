# Phase 4: Business Clients Paid Verification Model (25-36 Months)

In the 4th phase, the goal of Mercury is to become the compliance infrastructure for public blockchains and DApp ecosystems. This will be achieved through providing VC verification services to DApps, leading to revenue growth, while deepening partnerships with public blockchains to expand the reach within the broader ecosystem. The primary revenue sources in this phase will include two parts:

1. VC Verification Fee: Priced at 1 USDC per verification, with the revenue split as follows: 20% to Mercury,40% to the public blockchain hosting the DApp,40% to the user. This revenue-sharing model is designed to incentivize both public blockchains and users to participate.
2. Public Blockchain Compliance Service Annual Fee: Mercury will offer modular compliance development services for high-transaction-volume public blockchains. The fees will be tiered based on on-chain transaction volume, ranging from 100,000 to 1.5 million USDC per year.

This flexible pricing strategy will cater to the scale and needs of different public blockchains.
