# Phase 3: Solutions for Government Clients(25-48 Months)

In the third phase, Mercury will be committed to opening up the channel between on-chain compliance and government regulation, with the goal of becoming an on-chain technology solution provider for government tax and financial regulatory departments, while maintaining revenue diversity through B-side advanced modules. The sources of income include two parts: first, the government regulatory system subscription fee, which is paid on demand (0.05 USDC/time); in terms of market entry strategy, Mercury will enter the market through government pilot projects, with the goal of cooperating with the tax bureau of one country or region (such as Singapore or Switzerland) to pilot the on-chain tax verification system and the on-chain tax audit system; at the same time, cooperate with international tax consulting agencies (such as PwC, E\&Y) as intermediaries for government pilots to reduce direct policy barriers.
